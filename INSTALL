REQUIREMENTS

You'll need a decent compiler, we have tested gcc on FreeBSD and
Sun Studio 8 on Solaris Sparc.

In order to configure dnsbl queries you need c-ares library for
asynhronous dns queries. You can download it here:
http://daniel.haxx.se/projects/c-ares/

COMPILING

You should be able to compile it for testing by just commanding:

$ ./configure
$ sudo make install

Default install location is /usr/local which can be overridden by
specifying a --prefix argument to configure.  Run ./configure --help 
for other options.

BASIC CONFIGURATION

An example configuration is included in doc/example/grossd.conf:
It is installed also as the default configuration in
$PREFIX/etc/grossd.conf. You may tell grossd to use another config
file via -f command line option. 

sync_listen is the server ip, and sync_peer stands for the replication
partners ip address.

Grossd query server defaults to port 1111/tcp with proto=postfix,
port 1111/udp with proto=sjsms and replication service
(if configured) to port 1112/tcp.

Detailed information about each option is included within the 
example configuration file.

BLOOM FILTER CONFIGURATION

The server keeps the state information in the Bloom filter bit arrays.
By the nature of the filters you can insert elements in the filters, but
not to remove them. So we actually use several filters, and rotate them
on intervals. The actual filter is just a logical OR of those rotating
filters. number_buffers is the number of the rotating filters, and
rotate_interval is the interval in seconds. 

The default setting in the example grossd.cnf is:
number_buffers = 8
rotate_interval = 3600

So, this will give you approximately 60 * 7.5 minutes worth of state 
information. That is, any greylisted triplet will be stored for 
7.5 hours on average.  If you find that remote servers are taking 
longer than 7.5 hours to retry their messages, then you should increase
the the number_buffers setting accordingly.  Alternatively, you could
increase the rotate_interval, but setting this value too high isn't 
recommended.

The filter_bits setting (default is 22) defines the size of each 
Bloom filter.  Increasing the filter_bits setting will reduce the 
likelihood of false positives within the filter.  See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter for more information.

CREATE STATEFILE

If you get this far, you can start the server. I suggest you
run the server first in foreground with -d option. If you
configured statefile, you have to start grossd with -C option
in order to create the state file.

$ sudo -u nobody $PREFIX/sbin/grossd -C
(wait until the statefile stops growing, then kill grossd)

Note: make sure that the run-time user has permissions to create
and write to the statefile.

SERVER STARTUP

To start the grossd server, just run this.

$ sudo -u nobody $PREFIX/sbin/grossd

After starting, you can test it with $PREFIX/bin/gclient.

MTA CONFIGURATION

Although never tested in production, Gross should work with
Postfix's native filtering protocol.

On the other hand, SJSMS needs some mapping entry for queries.
This is an example production server config:

ORIG_MAIL_ACCESS

! allow all DSNs and MDNs
  TCP|*|*|*|*|*|*|tcp_local||*|*  $Y$E
! allow all incoming mail to postmaster and abuse
  TCP|*|*|*|*|*|*|tcp_local|*|*|postmaster@*  $Y$E
  TCP|*|*|*|*|*|*|tcp_local|*|*|abuse@*  $Y$E
! use gross to check all triplets (client_ip,sender,recipient)
  TCP|*|*|*|*|*|*|tcp_local|*|*|*  $[/usr/local/gross/lib/grosscheck.so,grosscheck,10.10.13.1,10.10.13.2,1111,$2,$=$8$_,$=$6$_]

The server will always query the first server if it's available.

First, when you have only one server, you can test it like this:

  TCP|*|*|*|*|*|*|tcp_local|*|*|*  $[/path/to/grosscheck.so,grosscheck,127.0.0.1,,1111,$2,$=$8$_,$=$6$_]

SOPHOS BLOCKER INTEGRATION

grossd is able to query the proprietary Sophos Blocker service, which 
is basically a private DNSBL that is part of the Sophos PureMessage 
product.  You can configure grossd to query your existing 
PureMessage system, or install it on the same server(s) as gross.

DNS CACHING

If you process a high volume of email traffic, then you will
definitely want to install a local caching DNS server. 
BIND/named is recommended.

KNOWN ISSUES

See http://code.google.com/p/gross/issues/list for bugs
and known issues.

LOGGING AND TROUBLESHOOTING

grossd logs everything through syslog. Facility is LOG_MAIL, loglevel
defaults to INFO. You can control logging with 'log_level' and
'syslog_facility' configuration options.

You can enable full debugging by starting grossd with -D command line
option. You may also want -d, as grossd then writes output on standard
terminal instead of syslog.

gclient is a tool for manually querying the grossd server.  You can 
install and run gclient on any server.

$ gclient PROTOCOL sender recipient ip_address [runs] [host port]
$ /usr/local/bin/gclient sjsms foo@abc.com bar@def.org 127.0.0.2 2 10.10.10.13 1111

(note that 127.0.0.2 will always be blacklisted)

SOLARIS 10 SERVICE MANAGEMENT FACILITY

If you are running Gross on Solaris 10, then you should utilize the
Service Management Facility.  SMF is better than init.d scripts
for starting and stopping services.  SMF will detect if Gross dies or
is killed, and will restart it automatically.

An example SMF configuration is included in doc/examples/smf-definition.xml

To import the service:

$ sudo svccfg import doc/examples/smf-definition.xml

To start/stop Gross:

$ sudo svcadm [enable|disable] grossd

To check the status of Gross:

$ svcs -x -v grossd

INSTALLING ON SOLARIS 10 ZONES

Gross can be installed on Solaris 10 zones.  The one caveat is that
you can't install things in /usr when you are using sparse zones.  
This means that you must either

a) install c-ares and gross in /usr on the global zone

   The sparse zone will be able to execute the gross binary from 
   /usr but your configuration and state file should be kept on the 
   sparse zone (e.g. in /opt)

b) install c-ares and gross in /opt (for example) on the sparse zone

   For example, you can install c-ares on the sparse zone 
   with "--prefix=/opt/local".  Then, to configure grossd, run this:

   $ env LDFLAGS='-L/opt/local/lib -R/opt/local/lib' ./configure
   --prefix=/opt/gross
